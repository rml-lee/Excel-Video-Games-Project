This project is based on the cleaned **video game sales and ratings** dataset used in my [SQL project](https://github.com/rml-lee/MYSQL-Tableau-Video-Games-Project). 

Microsoft Excel is used to answer a few business questions about the video game industry. This showcases my proficiency in using Pivot Tables and Visualizations.

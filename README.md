# Excel-Video-Games-Project

This project is based on the cleaned **video game sales and ratings** dataset used in my [SQL project](https://github.com/rml-lee/MYSQL-Tableau-Video-Games-Project). 

Here, I use Microsoft Excel to answer a few business questions which show my proficiency in using Pivot Tables and Vizualizations.
